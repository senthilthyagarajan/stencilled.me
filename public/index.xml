      <description>This R shiny app is for all the home chefs out there looking to try different recipes, especially now that we are all social distancing and looking at ways to keep us sane! (Yes, cooking is a form of meditation wherein the end, you have something to eat :D). From a database of 28000 + recipes, just enter the ingredients you wish to filter on and the type of cuisine and you will see all the recipes with your specified ingredients from your favorite cuisine!</description>

      <title>Styling DataTables</title>

      <guid>http://www.stencilled.me/posts/2019-04-20-stylingdt/</guid>
      <description>Most of the shiny apps have tables as the primary component. Now lets say you want to prettify your app and style the tables. All you need understand how tables are built using HTML. This is how the default datatable looks like in the app.
In order to build the html table I have used a function table_frame which can be used as a container in DT::renderdatatable. This function basically uses htmltools.</description>

      <description>Tables are very much the standard way of representing data in dashboard along with visualizations. Wouldnt it be more useful if you could edit the values in the tables to trigger some calculations and update the values on the fly . These can be used for adjusting allocations or budgets in a project.
Libraries The libraries which we will be using are shiny for the app itself, dplyr and DT for displaying and editing the tables.</description>

      <description>Most of the dashboards / R shiny app are viewed by the people who want to view the underyling data without doing much analysis. While they view the KPI&amp;rsquo;s , the charts and the tables it would be also an important for them to take the results out of the app for meetings and presenations. One of way doing it is the traditionally downloading the reports. But to make it one step easier they could also be given an option to email these reports.</description>

      <description>In this post we see how the no. of breweries stack up against no. of colleges across USA. Here I am using d3js and a grid bar chartwhere each grid represents 5 breweries/colleges.I collected the data for Brewery from Beer Advocate and for colleges from wikipedia

      <description>Recently while I was searching for trend data I came across Google Trends. So in the post I am using gtrends, a r package to understand the trends and display it using a R shiny app using the shinymaterial package. The shinymaterial package tends to move away from the traditional shiny dashboard layouts and design. You can use this shiny app from here.</description>

      <description>Recently I was searching for some gifts when I stumbled across Sound Viz and Cumberland Coast . These were your favorite songs which were visualized and printed. So that&amp;rsquo;s when I started looking into on how could you visualize them. So I wanted to try the same and that’s when I came across the r packages tuneR and seewave. Now I knew that I wanted to visualize the song but then I also wanted to see how different are the visualizations for the same song in an original version and the acoustic version.</description>

      <description>In this day and age of so many sharing services like Uber and Lyft , pricey hotels are being replaced by Airbnb. Students, working people and travelers wouldn&amp;rsquo;t always want to pay a high price for staying a couple of nights at the Marriott and would rather stay at a place where that has the basic amenities needed for them at a reasonable price. In this project I am trying to understand the listings put on Airbnb on how the price varies by neighborhood ,house type and various other factors.</description>

      <description>While working on a couple of projects involving beer data I did land up at breweries association. They have a data set on all the breweries across the US. This raw html table was scrapped ,cleaned and geocoded using R. You can find the R Scripts which I used for this project here.
Once the data was ready this was put to use by being displayed on a web mapping application built on js and bootstrap.</description>

which was done for one state. The source for this data is

&lt;p&gt;When you think about Texas, the first thing that would come in mind is barbecue which of course  pairs well with a good beer. In this post I have mapped each state in the
US ranked based on the breweries or wineries present. I got the data from the Brewers Association and the American Winery Guide. With data visualization being so
important in representing the dataset I have used hexbins shapefile from   &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/donmeltz/US-States---Hexbins&#34;&gt;Don Meltz&amp;rsquo;s repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>As I have been using R for a while, one of the things I wanted to do was a time series map. Most of the time series maps I see have sliders to change the years. While looking at how to make time series maps I happened to lear how to make a GIF with a set of images.
So I thought, how about making an election based map over the past elections.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I visited Austin and many of my friends had mentioned about the variety in food options here.
So my wife and I decided to search for places to eat on the foursquare app. As a standard search filter
with high rating we ended up at pretty good places and foursquare did alert us to checkins whenever we
reached a place. Post the trip I wanted to see how many people do checkins using this app and how the checkins are
correlated with the ratings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello World !!! This is my first project using d3js. Being a GIS professional, visualization is always a part of job.
I always wanted to learn different ways for visualizing data.Let it be a simple plot using R or a choropleth map using Arcmap .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project I am trying to display how the NFL season 2016-17 went about. Ofcourse was surprised to see the Cowboys doing so well.
May be we got our own Tom Brady.I started working with the data grabbed from the NFL site for how the season went by each seasson.
Below is the location for the each team.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
