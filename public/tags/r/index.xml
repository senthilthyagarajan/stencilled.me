      <description>In this day and age of so many sharing services like Uber and Lyft , pricey hotels are being replaced by Airbnb. Students, working people and travelers wouldn&amp;rsquo;t always want to pay a high price for staying a couple of nights at the Marriott and would rather stay at a place where that has the basic amenities needed for them at a reasonable price. In this project I am trying to understand the listings put on Airbnb on how the price varies by neighborhood ,house type and various other factors.</description>

      <description>While working on a couple of projects involving beer data I did land up at breweries association. They have a data set on all the breweries across the US. This raw html table was scrapped ,cleaned and geocoded using R. You can find the R Scripts which I used for this project here. Once the data was ready this was put to use by being displayed on a web mapping application built on js and bootstrap.</description>

      <description>As I have been using R for a while, one of the things I wanted to do was a time series map. Most of the time series maps I see have sliders to change the years. While looking at how to make time series maps I happened to lear how to make a GIF with a set of images.
So I thought, how about making an election based map over the past elections.</description>

      <title>Where do people eat in Austin ??</title>

      <description>Recently I visited Austin and many of my friends had mentioned about the variety in food options here. So my wife and I decided to search for places to eat on the foursquare app. As a standard search filter with high rating we ended up at pretty good places and foursquare did alert us to checkins whenever we reached a place. Post the trip I wanted to see how many people do checkins using this app and how the checkins are correlated with the ratings.</description>
