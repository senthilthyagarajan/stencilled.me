      <description>While working on a couple of projects involving beer data I did land up at breweries association. They have a data set on all the breweries across the US. This raw html table was scrapped ,cleaned and geocoded using R. You can find the R Scripts which I used for this project here.
Once the data was ready this was put to use by being displayed on a web mapping application built on js and bootstrap.</description>
