I started working on this visualation after coming across &lt;a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3081153">Mike Bostock's shape tweening bl.ock&lt;/a> ,
 which was done for one state. The source for this data is
Insurance Institute for Highway Service(IIHS). The size of the square is based on the motor vehicle deaths per 100,000 people(2015).

Across 7 books/ 8 movies there are so many characters in this series by J.K Rowling. For this project I have got the data from
&lt;a href="https://data.world/harishkgarg/harry-potter-universe">data.world&lt;/a>. All files here were combined to create a json with nodes and links.
 Using d3js I have visualized the characters connected to each other.

Hello World !!! This is my first project using d3js. Being a GIS professional, visualization is always a part of job.
I always wanted to learn different ways for visualizing data.Let it be a simple plot using R or a choropleth map using Arcmap .

In this project I am trying to display how the NFL season 2016-17 went about. Ofcourse was surprised to see the Cowboys doing so well.
May be we got our own Tom Brady.I started working with the data grabbed from the NFL site for how the season went by each seasson.
Below is the location for the each team.
