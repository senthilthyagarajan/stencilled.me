      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started working on this visualation after coming across  &lt;a href=&#34;https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3081153&#34;&gt;Mike Bostock&amp;rsquo;s shape tweening bl.ock&lt;/a&gt; ,
which was done for one state. The source for this data is
Insurance Institute for Highway Service(IIHS). The size of the square is based on the motor vehicle deaths per 100,000 people(2015).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Where do people eat in Austin ??</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I visited Austin and many of my friends had mentioned about the variety in food options here.
So my wife and I decided to search for places to eat on the foursquare app. As a standard search filter
with high rating we ended up at pretty good places and foursquare did alert us to checkins whenever we
reached a place. Post the trip I wanted to see how many people do checkins using this app and how the checkins are
correlated with the ratings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello World !!! This is my first project using d3js. Being a GIS professional, visualization is always a part of job.
I always wanted to learn different ways for visualizing data.Let it be a simple plot using R or a choropleth map using Arcmap .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project I am trying to display how the NFL season 2016-17 went about. Ofcourse was surprised to see the Cowboys doing so well.
May be we got our own Tom Brady.I started working with the data grabbed from the NFL site for how the season went by each seasson.
Below is the location for the each team.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
