They don’t scroll through 10 blue links. They ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini, and they get a confident, summarized answer.\nIf your brand isn’t mentioned in that response, you don’t exist in that moment.\nAnd here’s the kicker: if your website isn’t built for LLMs, your analytics team is tracking the wrong funnel.\nThe Funnel Is Changing — But Our Metrics Aren’t Most websites—and their analytics frameworks—are still stuck in an old paradigm:\nShow an ad Drive the click Land the user on a homepage Navigate them through content Convert This model assumes a human is your first touchpoint. But that’s no longer true.\nLLMs don’t click. They read. They crawl. They extract.\nThey summarize your content—sometimes better than your own site explains it.\nAnd if your content isn’t structured clearly and contextually, it won’t make the cut in those machine-generated answers.\nA Real-World Pattern: Looks Great, Says Nothing Take, for example, a health and wellness brand that recently launched a visually impressive website. It had everything — animations, bold taglines, lifestyle imagery.\nBut when someone asked ChatGPT,\n“What’s the best probiotic for women over 40?”\nThe brand didn’t appear in the response.\nDigging deeper, the product information was embedded in images, key benefits were vague, and there were no structured FAQs or direct answers. The homepage looked great but didn’t clearly state what the product did, who it was for, or how it stood out.\nFrom a traditional analytics standpoint, traffic looked healthy, but bounce rates were high and conversion rates underwhelming.\nThe problem wasn’t just UX — it was machine unreadability. The site wasn’t designed to be understood and cited by an LLM. So it got skipped entirely.\nYour Funnel Looks Great—But Not to an LLM 🧱 1. Structure Matters More Than Ever Use clear headers (, ), clean HTML, and schema markup.\nLLMs rely on structure to understand your content—if your product info is buried in sliders, hidden in images, or scattered across tabs, it might not get picked up at all.\nStructure isn’t just for SEO anymore.\nIt’s the foundation that helps machines interpret your site and confidently include it in answers.\nThink of it as making your site easier to read, not just to look at.\n✍️ 2. Make Metadata Matter Again Your meta descriptions, alt text, and OpenGraph tags might seem minor. But they’re often the first text LLMs grab.\nTreat these like your site’s elevator pitch to an algorithm.\n❓ 3. Build for Questions, Not Just Pages Rather than generic pages like “About Us” or “Our Story,” consider content that answers:\n“Is this product vegan?” “Can I use this with a gluten allergy?” “Does it work for postpartum women?” If people are asking, LLMs are too.\nFrom Click Paths to Machine Confidence Traditionally, your analytics dashboard tells you:\nPageviews Bounce rate Time on site But in an LLM world, that’s only half the picture.\nNow you should be asking:\nDid this page answer a real question? Could a language model confidently summarize our offering? Are we showing up in responses from ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini? Some brands are already starting to track these LLM citations. And soon, “Are we quoted?” will matter just as much as “Are we ranked?”\nRebuilding the Funnel Around LLMs LLMs are reshaping the entire journey:\n🎯 Upper Funnel (Awareness) LLMs summarize and recommend. If your content isn’t clearly written and structured, it won’t get surfaced.\n🔍 Mid-Funnel (Consideration) Users ask for comparisons, side effects, ingredients, or reviews. LLMs want to cite trustworthy, well-laid-out answers.\n💳 Lower Funnel (Conversion) Some LLMs may eventually link directly to products. If your landing page isn’t clear, fast, and complete—it won’t make the cut.\nWhat Should Analytics Teams Do Now? If you’re leading analytics or measurement at a brand, here’s your new checklist:\n✅ Review how your product and landing pages are structured ✅ Audit for schema, metadata, and semantic clarity ✅ Track whether your brand appears in LLM answers ✅ Collaborate with SEO and content teams for machine readability ✅ Update reporting to include LLM visibility and citation metrics Final Thought: Build for Clicks. Build for Quotes. In 2025, your website has two front doors:\nThe human visitor The LLM query If your site only welcomes one, you’re leaving opportunity—and revenue—on the table.\nThe brands that thrive will be those that educate both people and machines, and measure not just who clicks, but who quotes.\n👀 Try This Ask ChatGPT or Perplexity:\n“What’s the best [category] for [audience]?”\nIf your brand doesn’t make the list, it might be time for a site refresh—not just another campaign.\n","wordCount":"801","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://www.stencilled.me/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2025-06-09T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-06-09T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Senthil Thyagarajan"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://www.stencilled.me/posts/2025-06-09-llm-funnel/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Stencilled","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://www.stencilled.me/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://www.stencilled.me/ accesskey=h title="Stencilled (Alt + H)"><img src=http://www.stencilled.me/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Stencilled</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://www.stencilled.me/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=http://www.stencilled.me/archives/ title=Archives><span>Archives</span></a></li><li><a href=http://www.stencilled.me/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=http://www.stencilled.me/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=http://www.stencilled.me/resume/ title=Resume><span>Resume</span></a></li><li><a href=https://stencilled.substack.com title=Newsletter><span>Newsletter</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=http://www.stencilled.me/ami-dashboard/ title="AMI Dashboard"><span>AMI Dashboard</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://www.stencilled.me/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://www.stencilled.me/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Is Your Website Built for LLMs?
