    <p>As I have been using R for a while, one of the things I wanted to do was a time series map. Most of the time series maps I see have sliders to change the years.
While looking at how to make time series maps I happened to lear how to make a GIF with a set of images.</p>

<p>So I thought, how about making an election based map over the past elections. First I couldn’t get the historical data. Also, there’s an abundance of election news right now anyways, so I didn’t want to take on that topic. Then I went on making several maps to see which demographic variable would be a right fit for this exercise. I ended up using “People with at least one Health Insurance coverage”.
This variable was strictly selected for learning purpose. The library I have used here is Choroplethr and ChoroplethrMaps by Ari Lamstien.</p>

<p>Now to get the demographics data into R I have used the American Community Survey(ACS) library. For this you must get API key from  <a href="http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html">ACS website</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">library(acs)
library(choroplethr)
library(choroplethrMaps)
library(ggplot2)

#api.key.install(key=&quot;API from the ACS website&quot;)

</code></pre>

<p>Once  this is done you can use the ACS lookup function to search for the variables list.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">acs.lookup(keyword = &quot;Population&quot;, endyear = 2013 )
</code></pre>

<p>Now as I mentioned above I did want to do make maps for over a time period. So their are two ways to make them. Either save each map individually or
just put them through a loop for all the years you want to make maps for . Below is the code for how to put through a loop and save all the maps at once.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r"># array of years
vr&lt;-c(2013,2014,2015)

for (i in 1:3) {

vr[i] &lt;- vr[i]

print(vr[i])

getdata = get_acs_data(&quot;B27010&quot;, &quot;county&quot;,endyear=vr[i],span = 5, include_moe = FALSE)

str(getdata)

#to get this into a dataframe
df = getdata[[1]]

data(county.regions)
head(county.regions)

df2 = merge(df, county.regions)
df2 = df2[order(-df2$value), ]
head(df2)
totalCount &lt;- sum(df2$value)
totalCount


myplot&lt;- county_choropleth(df2, title = vr[i],legend = totalCount,county_zoom = NULL)

#use paste to covert params passed into it to a Character string.

ggsave(myplot,filename=paste(&quot;Health Coverage&quot;, vr[i],&quot;.png&quot;,sep=&quot;&quot;))

}
</code></pre>

<p>So once this was done  I get images like the one below for each year I have mentioned in the code.
<img src="Health Coverage2013.png" alt="This is an image" />
Once this was done I wanted to make a gif for all the individual maps. I have used <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php">ImageMagick</a> for it . Once your download and install it
go to the command prompt and go the path where all the images have been saved. Below is the command to generate the gifs.</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">
magick  -delay 100 -loop 0 *.png animation.gif

</code></pre>

<p>To break it down first you define how much should be the delay time , then select all the pngs in the folder and then the name you want to save the
gifs.</p>

<p><img src="Health_Insurance.gif" alt="This is an image" /></p>

<p>This particular exercise was mainly on learning how to make choropleth maps using demographics variable and publish them as a GIF to see how the variable varies over a time period. Also you could see in the numbers that the Insurance coverage did increase over the time period.</p>

<p>Post this I did want to see how it could be done for all the states in the US separately. Below is the code and the output too. The demographics variable I have used here is the CY population.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">library(acs)
library(choroplethr)
library(choroplethrMaps)
library(ggplot2)

#api.key.install(key=&quot;API from the ACS website&quot;)

vr&lt;-c(2015)

for (i in 1:1) {

vr[i] &lt;- vr[i]
print(vr[i])

l = get_acs_data(&quot;B00001&quot;, &quot;county&quot;,endyear=vr[i],span = 5, include_moe = TRUE)

str(l)

df = l[[1]]

head(df)

data(county.regions)
head(county.regions)

df2 = merge(df, county.regions)
df2 = df2[order(-df2$value), ]
head(df2)
totalCount &lt;- sum(df2$value)
totalCount

stt &lt;- c(unique(df2$state.name))
stt

for ( i in 1:51) {
  print(stt[i])
  myplot&lt;- county_choropleth(df2, title = &quot;&quot;,legend = stt[i],state_zoom = stt[i])
ggsave(myplot,filename=paste(&quot;Population_&quot;,stt[i],&quot;.png&quot;,sep=&quot;&quot;))
}
}

</code></pre>

<p><img src="Population_State.gif" alt="This is an image" /></p>

<p>You could change to any demographics variable you want and see how many years the data is available for and make maps as per your needs.
Happy GIFFING !!!</p>
