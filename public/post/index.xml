But for many, it remains locked away, accessible only to a select few. The process is all too familiar: a question arises about a campaign, a ticket is filed, and days—or even weeks—later, a report arrives. By then, the opportunity to act may have already passed.
This delay, this friction between question and answer, is a major bottleneck to agility and growth.</description></item><item><title>Get over that data fatigue</title><link>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2020-08-15-datafatigue/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>senthil.thyagarajan@gmail.com (Senthil Thyagarajan)</author><guid>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2020-08-15-datafatigue/</guid><description>So you are looking at numbers everyday. These can be in excel sheets / google sheets while cleaning data or trying to get some insights out of the tables in various dashboards you see daily. These numbers might be currency , rates or just volume of any metrics you want to track.
So how would you find the outliers across these tables, the best peforming KPI&amp;rsquo;s , correlations between various metrics.</description></item><item><title>Whats Cooking ??</title><link>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2020-03-29-whatscooking/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>senthil.thyagarajan@gmail.com (Senthil Thyagarajan)</author><guid>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2020-03-29-whatscooking/</guid><description>This R shiny app is for all the home chefs out there looking to try different recipes, especially now that we are all social distancing and looking at ways to keep us sane!

Now lets say you want to prettify your app and style the tables. All you need understand how tables are built using HTML. This is how the default datatable looks like in the app.
In order to build the html table I have used a function table_frame which can be used as a container in DT::renderdatatable. This function basically uses htmltools.</description></item><item><title>Edit datatables in R shiny app</title><link>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2019-04-18-editable/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>senthil.thyagarajan@gmail.com (Senthil Thyagarajan)</author><guid>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2019-04-18-editable/</guid><description>Tables are very much the standard way of representing data in dashboard along with visualizations. Wouldnt it be more useful if you could edit the values in the tables to trigger some calculations and update the values on the fly . These can be used for adjusting allocations or budgets in a project.
Libraries The libraries which we will be using are shiny for the app itself, dplyr and DT for displaying and editing the tables.</description></item><item><title>Download and Email reports in R Shiny app</title><link>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2019-04-14-downloadshiny/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>senthil.thyagarajan@gmail.com (Senthil Thyagarajan)</author><guid>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2019-04-14-downloadshiny/</guid><description>Most of the dashboards / R shiny app are viewed by the people who want to view the underyling data without doing much analysis. While they view the KPI&amp;rsquo;s , the charts and the tables it would be also an important for them to take the results out of the app for meetings and presenations. One of way doing it is the traditionally downloading the reports. But to make it one step easier they could also be given an option to email these reports.</description></item><item><title>Colleges vs Breweries - What tops in your State ?</title><link>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2018-09-26-college-brewery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>senthil.thyagarajan@gmail.com (Senthil Thyagarajan)</author><guid>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2018-09-26-college-brewery/</guid><description> In this post we see how the no. of breweries stack up against no. of colleges across USA.

You can use this shiny app from here.</description></item><item><title>Visualizing your favourite song?</title><link>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2018-10-02-song-wave/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>senthil.thyagarajan@gmail.com (Senthil Thyagarajan)</author><guid>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2018-10-02-song-wave/</guid><description>Recently I was searching for some gifts when I stumbled across Sound Viz and Cumberland Coast . These were your favorite songs which were visualized and printed. So that&amp;rsquo;s when I started looking into on how could you visualize them. So I wanted to try the same and that’s when I came across the r packages tuneR and seewave. Now I knew that I wanted to visualize the song but then I also wanted to see how different are the visualizations for the same song in an original version and the acoustic version.</description></item><item><title>MTA Subway Ridership</title><link>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2018-08-16-mta-subway-ridership/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>senthil.thyagarajan@gmail.com (Senthil Thyagarajan)</author><guid>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2018-08-16-mta-subway-ridership/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Visualizing Airbnb listings.</title><link>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2017-10-25-airbnb-listing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>senthil.thyagarajan@gmail.com (Senthil Thyagarajan)</author><guid>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2017-10-25-airbnb-listing/</guid><description>In this day and age of so many sharing services like Uber and Lyft , pricey hotels are being replaced by Airbnb. Students, working people and travelers wouldn&amp;rsquo;t always want to pay a high price for staying a couple of nights at the Marriott and would rather stay at a place where that has the basic amenities needed for them at a reasonable price. In this project I am trying to understand the listings put on Airbnb on how the price varies by neighborhood ,house type and various other factors.</description></item><item><title>Taps near you</title><link>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2017-09-18-taps-near-you/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>senthil.thyagarajan@gmail.com (Senthil Thyagarajan)</author><guid>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2017-09-18-taps-near-you/</guid><description>While working on a couple of projects involving beer data I did land up at breweries association. They have a data set on all the breweries across the US. This raw html table was scrapped ,cleaned and geocoded using R. You can find the R Scripts which I used for this project here. Once the data was ready this was put to use by being displayed on a web mapping application built on js and bootstrap.</description></item><item><title>States to Shapes</title><link>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2017-05-10-states-to-shapes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>senthil.thyagarajan@gmail.com (Senthil Thyagarajan)</author><guid>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2017-05-10-states-to-shapes/</guid><description>

I started working on this visualation after coming across &lt;a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3081153">Mike Bostock's shape tweening bl.ock&lt;/a> ,
 which was done for one state. The source for this data is
Insurance Institute for Highway Service(IIHS). The size of the square is based on the motor vehicle deaths per 100,000 people(2015).

Across 7 books/ 8 movies there are so many characters in this series by J.K Rowling. For this project I have got the data from
&lt;a href="https://data.world/harishkgarg/harry-potter-universe">data.world&lt;/a>. All files here were combined to create a json with nodes and links.
 Using d3js I have visualized the characters connected to each other.

When you think about Texas, the first thing that would come in mind is barbecue which of course pairs well with a good beer. In this post I have mapped each state in the
US ranked based on the breweries or wineries present. I got the data from the Brewers Association and the American Winery Guide. With data visualization being so
important in representing the dataset I have used hexbins shapefile from &lt;a href="https://github.com/donmeltz/US-States---Hexbins">Don Meltz's repo&lt;/a>.

Most of the time series maps I see have sliders to change the years. While looking at how to make time series maps I happened to lear how to make a GIF with a set of images.
So I thought, how about making an election based map over the past elections.</description></item><item><title>Top Beers in 2016.</title><link>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2017-02-22-topbeers2016/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>senthil.thyagarajan@gmail.com (Senthil Thyagarajan)</author><guid>http://www.stencilled.me/post/2017-02-22-topbeers2016/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->

Hello World !!! This is my first project using d3js. Being a GIS professional, visualization is always a part of job.
I always wanted to learn different ways for visualizing data.Let it be a simple plot using R or a choropleth map using Arcmap .

In this project I am trying to display how the NFL season 2016-17 went about. Ofcourse was surprised to see the Cowboys doing so well.
May be we got our own Tom Brady.I started working with the data grabbed from the NFL site for how the season went by each seasson.
Below is the location for the each team.
