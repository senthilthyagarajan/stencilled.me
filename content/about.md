Hello, I'm **Senthil Thyagarajan**.

My journey began with a school stencil, sparking a passion for maps that evolved into a career in data analytics. Today, I lead AI and analytics at Mekanism and write on **Stencilled**, where I explore how to make analytics faster, clearer, and actually helpful.

I'm obsessed with using AI to make analytics truly usableâ€”like one-click summaries that replace 40-slide decks, creative testing tools that show which TikTok ads perform, and RAG-powered bots that pull answers straight from campaign data. I've also built Slack-integrated anomaly alerts that flag issues before anyone even logs in.

**My goal?** To make analytics feel intuitiveâ€”not intimidating. Whether it's building tools, leading teams, or simplifying strategy decks, I focus on turning data into decisions.

Outside of work, I'm usually building LEGO Formula 1 cars with my kids or experimenting in the kitchen. I live in New Jersey with my wife and two little ones, and I bring curiosity, clarity, and a builder's mindset to everything I do.
