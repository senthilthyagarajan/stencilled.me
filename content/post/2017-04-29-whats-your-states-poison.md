When you think about Texas, the first thing that would come in mind is barbecue which of course could pair well with good beer. In this post I have mapped each state in the 
US ranked based on the breweries or wineries present respectievly.I got the data from the Brewers Association and the American Winery Guide.With data visualization being so 
important in representing the dataset I have used hexbins shapefile from   <a href="https://github.com/donmeltz/US-States---Hexbins">Don Meltz's repo</a>.

Below are the maps for how the states are ranked .

While doing this whole excerice in QGIS , I did see an extension "qgis2threejs". Using this extension and the number of wineries as a extrusion parameter
this was another way of represeting the data.

It was pretty surprising to see Texas being more of a wine state than a beer state . Well that again gives me more reason to check travel places for a good beer.
