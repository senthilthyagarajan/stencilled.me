While working on a couple of projects involving beer data I did land up at <a href="https://www.brewersassociation.org/">breweries association</a>. They have a data set on all the breweries across the US.
This raw html table was scrapped ,cleaned and geocoded using R. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/senthilthyagarajan/brewerymaps/tree/master/rscripts">R Scripts</a> which I used for this project here.

Once the data was ready this was put to use by being displayed on a web mapping application built on js and bootstrap. This responsive web application  can be used on your mobile devices can be used while you are traveling places or planning to try a few new taps near you . A few other features in this map application are Search functionality using autocomplete ,find 5 nearest breweries from your current location and share via email and filter the breweries that are being displayed in your current extent.
