This R shiny app is for all the home chefs out there looking to try different recipes, especially now that we are all social distancing and looking at ways to keep us sane! (Yes, cooking is a form of meditation wherein the end, you have something to eat :D). From a database of 28000 + recipes, just enter the ingredients you wish to filter on and the type of cuisine and you will see all the recipes with your specified ingredients from your favorite cuisine!

Bon Appetite!
