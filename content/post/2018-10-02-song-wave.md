title: Visualizing your favourite song?

Recently I was searching for some gifts when I stumbled across <a href="https://www.soundviz.com/">Sound Viz</a> and <a href="http://cumberlandcoast.com/">Cumberland Coast</a> .
These were your favorite songs which were visualized and printed. So that's when I started looking into on how could you visualize them. So I wanted to try the same and thatâ€™s when I came across the r packages `tuneR` and `seewave`. Now I knew that I wanted to visualize the song but then I also wanted to see how different are the visualizations for the same song in an original version and the acoustic version. So I did download both the versions of the song Take On Me by A-ha. Since the wave format is too big to-be processed I did clip the songs to 1-minute duration. Below are the visualizations for the different versions of the same song.

Following is the code which I used to generate the waveforms above:

```
library(tuneR)
library(seewave)

setWavPlayer('mplayer') # Set the command-line WAV player
fin <- readWave('yoyoma_clip.wav')

data = (fin)

snd = data@left

par(bg="orange")
# plot waveform
orig_left <- plot(snd, type = 'l', xlab = 'Samples', ylab = 'Amplitude',col = c( "blue","green", "orange"),frame.plot=FALSE)

```
And finally finishing this post with one of my favorite song.
