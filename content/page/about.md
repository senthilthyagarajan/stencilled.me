
Hello, I’m Senthil Thyagarajan. My journey began with a school stencil, sparking a passion for mapping that evolved into a career in data analytics. As the Analytics Director at Mekanism and the founder of Stencilled, I specialize in transforming complex data into clear, visual narratives that drive informed decision-making. I integrate the latest AI trends into real-time reporting and strategic insights, ensuring every project is both innovative and impactful.

Outside of work, I’m a dedicated LEGO builder—currently immersed in Formula 1 sets—and an enthusiastic home cook who loves experimenting with new recipes. Based in New Jersey with my wife and two kids, I bring creativity, precision, and a touch of playfulness to everything I do.

Welcome to my professional space, where data meets design and innovation shapes the future.
