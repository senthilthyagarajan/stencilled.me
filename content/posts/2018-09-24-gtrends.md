title: Google Trends using gtrends and R shiny

Recently while I was searching for trend data I came across <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US">Google Trends</a>. So in the post I am using  `gtrends`, a r package to understand the trends and display it using a R shiny app using the `shinymaterial` package. The shinymaterial package tends to move away from the traditional shiny dashboard layouts and design. You can use this shiny app from  <a href="https://github.com/senthilthyagarajan/gtrends">here</a>.
